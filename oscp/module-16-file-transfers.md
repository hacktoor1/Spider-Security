## Method 1: Python pty module <a href="#method-1-python-pty-module" id="method-1-python-pty-module"></a>

One of my go-to commands for a long time after catching a dumb shell was to use Python to spawn a pty. The [pty module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pty.html) letâ€™s you spawn a psuedo-terminal that can fool commands like `su` into thinking they are being executed in a proper terminal. To upgrade a dumb shell, simply run the following command:

```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'                                      
```

```bash
stty raw -echo
```
